**Sudoku CLI game: Play it or brute force it!**

## About the Game

This is a simple command-line Sudoku game written in Rust. You can either play the game manually, attempting to solve a randomly generated Sudoku puzzle, or opt to use the brute-force solver to find the solution automatically.

## Features

- **Play Mode**: You can enter numbers manually and try to solve the puzzle yourself.
- **Brute-force Solver**: If you're stuck or just want to see the solution, you can use the built-in brute-force solver to complete the board.
